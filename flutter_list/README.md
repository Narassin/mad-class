# Assignment 1 - Flutter_List

A flutter app exercise for MAD Class. Due on the 14/4/2022.

## Instruction

Using List in Flutter
We learn a little bit about creating your app from scratch and using buttons and creating actions. 

In this assignment, you will create:

- [x] a flutter app
- [ ] create an object with hard coded list of items, for example apple, orange, rambutan
- [ ] Create a textbox widget to enter a choice of 1,2,3,or 
- [ ] Create a button to access the list and display the content of the list depending on what was chosen on the textbox. 


So if `1` is entered in the textbox, than, display `apple`.

Create a github, and submit the link to your repo for this assignment. 

## My Progress

#### Starting out

I started developing the app on the 6/4/22 by creating a flutter project using the Flutter plugin in VS Code, then proceed to delete the content of the lib/main.dart. Since I was still not familiar with the basic layout of the code, I refer to the Flutter documentation to get the basic app code for this. I ended up with something like this:

#### Sketching out the layout

Once I got the base done, I started with sketching the app layout as well as deciding the list that I wanted to make. As much it sounds easy to come up with a list, I don't like it being generic so I think something that I like and is appropiate to list down to sumbmit and I ended up with the following:

As you can see I went with Dragon as for the content of the list and I chose to mimic a bit the Pokedex kind of vibe for the layout.

#### Coding(part 1)

With a general idea of how I want my app to look like, I started coding the main elements needed in the app:
